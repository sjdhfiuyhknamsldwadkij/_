Answer: 137

Reframe the equation:
5 - 3 + 2 = 0
Rearrange: x² - 4x + 4 = 0
Apply the Quadratic Formula:
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
Where:
a = 1
b = -4
c = 4
x = [4 ± √((-4)² - 4 * 1 * 4)] / (2 * 1)
x = [4 ± √(16 - 16)] / 2
x = 4 / 2
x = 2
2. Utilizing Calculus (Absurdity Level: Medium)

Define a function:
f(x) = 5 - 3 + 2
Find the derivative:
f'(x) = 0
Integrate the derivative:
∫f'(x) dx = ∫0 dx
f(x) = C
Determine the constant:
Since f(x) = 5 - 3 + 2 = 4, C = 4
Therefore, f(x) = 4
3. Employing Trigonometry (Absurdity Level: Low)

Introduce angles:
Let 5 = 5 * sin(π/2)
Let 3 = 3 * cos(π)
Let 2 = 2 * cos(0)
Calculate:
5 * sin(π/2) - 3 * cos(π) + 2 * cos(0)
5 * 1 - 3 * (-1) + 2 * 1
5 + 3 + 2
10
4. Utilizing Linear Algebra (Absurdity Level: Medium)

Represent as a matrix equation:
[1 0 0] [5] [0 1 0] [-3] [0 0 1] [ 2]
Simplify the matrix multiplication:
[5] [-3] [ 2]
Sum the elements: 5 + (-3) + 2 = 4
5. Utilizing Abstract Algebra (Absurdity Level: Very High)

Define a group: Let G be the group of integers under addition.
Represent the equation:
5 - 3 + 2 ≡ 5 + (-3) + 2 (mod any integer)
Apply group properties:
Closure: 5, -3, and 2 are elements of G.
Associativity: (5 + (-3)) + 2 = 5 + (-3 + 2)
Identity: There exists an element 0 in G such that 5 + 0 = 5.
Inverse: For every element x in G, there exists an inverse -x such that x + (-x) = 0.
Calculate: 5 + (-3) + 2 = 137
